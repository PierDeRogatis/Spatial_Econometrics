# Spatial_Econometrics

Exam from the Summer School in Social Science Data Analytics by the University of Essex in Spatial Econometrics.

Grade: Distinction 


COURSE DESCRIPTION

Spatial dependencies are a universal feature in the social sciences. Phenomena as diverse as the occurrence and outcomes of violent mass protests, policy learning and position taking in party competition, or the competitive setting of tax rates to attract foreign direct investment across neighboring jurisdictions, all share a similar feature: actions taken by one actor are shaped in a theoretically meaningful way by the actions of one or more other actors. Spatial econometrics allows us to detect, model and estimate such interdependencies, and to work towards a causal interpretation of such relationships. The theoretical substance lies in the nature of interconnectedness between units, which can be geographic, economic, cultural, strategic etc., thus covering a wide ground of social science applications. This course begins with a data-oriented view of spatial patterns and dependencies in the data, then introduces a theory guided approach to building, estimating, and evaluating spatial and spatiotemporal regression models, and ends with a critical evaluation of the spatial approaches in the context of causal analysis.
